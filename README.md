### Reflections and Comments
learning web devlopment is very fun, today we took the switch function and i applied it in my (about me project), its like if function but uses cases and breaks. i

i think im doing fine in this course im just a little bit slow, so im taking notes on my notebook so i can refer to it easily.

ive learned a life lesson from coding: "doing a small mistakes can be fatal" :) 

mr bashar and the TAs are very helpful and collaborative.

i think i am becoming an adult learner, im not a child anymore :)

### lab3
well as a lab technician, i learned to to be specific with everything so im now being specific with my coding.

unfortunately, my prior experiences taught me that the last thing i need to do is asking for help, so i learned to always search for the answers and if i didn't find any then i must finally ask, and im doing that with coding, but it may be the reason why im slow. so i must be gaining that and start to ask.

the only thing that my prior experiences taught me is working for a long time isn't  tiring and im used to it.

I'm being a little bit anxious when someone at the class is asking an advanced question, and im starting to doubt myself if i should've known that, so i wish i can stop doing that.
